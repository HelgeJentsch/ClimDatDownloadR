  abstract = {Identification of the right abiotic factors for an ambient environment, soil, and water is critical for successful agricultural activities. However, these factors have been influenced by climate change, and other factors as such are no longer in their natural state of equilibrium. This has affected the ecosystem and has made previously suitable environments currently unsuitable for most organisms and crop production. To have production of healthy crops with high yield and quality, precise agricultural inputs are required, including the right environmental abiotic factors. This goal has been achieved to some extent via extensive studies carried out by various scholars to ascertain their impact and possible mitigating action. In this paper, we first investigated the factors that influence the environment adversely and the application of SDM as a solution depicted in other studies and further presented an overview of some of the SDM-based software packages and their applications, with much emphasis on agronomy. This review aims to provide insight into, how effective computer-based SDM has been or otherwise in resolving the challenges in the agriculture sector and the future direction for the application of SDM-based solutions.},

  abstract = {This collection of peer reviewed papers represents a concise, up-to-date summary of our current knowledge of planetary boundary layer (PBL) physics and parameterization. As such, it makes a major contribution to the interchange of knowledge and ideas between physicists, meteorologists and environmental modellers and sets out the course to be followed in subsequent research to improve PBL parameterizations in climate, numerical weather prediction, air quality, and emergency preparedness models. Major themes covered are: Nature and theory of turbulent boundary layers, Boundary layer flows - modelling and applications to environmental security, Nature, theory and modelling of boundary-layer flows, and Air flows within and above urban and other complex canopies - air-sea-ice interactions. The NATO Advanced Research Workshop, held in Dubrovnik, Croatia, 18-22 April 2006, that gave rise to this, book was attended by 57 scientists drawn from 21 countries on four continents. In recognition of his outstanding career and reaching the milestone age of 70, the workshop was dedicated to Professor Sergej Zilitinkevitch and a substantial number of contributions are based on or linked to his fundamental work. This volume presents peer-reviewed papers from the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Atmospheric Boundary Layers held in April 2006. The papers are divided into thematic sessions: nature and theory of turbulent boundary layers; boundary-layer flows: modeling and applications to environmental security; nature, theory and modeling of boundary-layer flows; air flows within and above urban and other complex canopies: air-sea-ice interaction.},

Data from three-dimensional fast response sonic anemometers at heights 6 m, 18 m, and 30 m above the ground are used for the analysis. Mountainous topography induces wind-direction variability over the measurement site throughout the day, which significantly influences the diurnal evolution of sensible heat flux, momentum flux, and turbulence kinetic energy. The increase and decrease of turbulence kinetic energy rely on the various production and consumption terms. Buoyancy dominates in the morning whereas in the afternoon both buoyancy and shear production contribute equally for the turbulence kinetic energy. The turbulence kinetic energy budget is also influenced by horizontal advection at the station. The correlation between turbulent decay and buoyancy (shear production) is negative (positive) in free convective conditions in the morning, whereas no correlation is observed for mixed convective conditions in the afternoon.},

  abstract = {Comparing and evaluating global climate datasets and their effect on model performance in regions with limited data availability has received little attention in ecological modeling studies so far. In this study, we aim at comparing the interpolated climate dataset Worldclim 1.4, which is the most widely used in ecological modeling studies, and the quasi-mechanistical downscaled climate dataset Chelsa, as well as their latest versions Worldclim 2.1 and Chelsa 1.2, with regard to their suitability for modeling studies. To evaluate the effect of these global climate datasets at the meso-scale, the ecological niche of Betula utilis in Nepal is modeled under current and future climate conditions. We underline differences regarding methodology and bias correction between Chelsa and Worldclim versions and highlight potential drawbacks for ecological models in remote high mountain regions. Regarding model performance and prediction plausibility under current climatic conditions, Chelsa-based models significantly outperformed Worldclim-based models, however, the latest version of Chelsa contains partially inherent distorted precipitation amounts. This study emphasizes that unmindful usage of climate data may have severe consequences for modeling treeline species in high-altitude regions as well as for future projections, if based on flawed current model predictions. The results illustrate the inevitable need for interdisciplinary investigations and collaboration between climate scientists and ecologists to enhance climate-based ecological model quality at meso- to local-scales by accounting for local-scale physical features at high temporal and spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a detailed description of the atmospheric conditions characterizing the high Himalayas, thanks to continuous observations begun in March 2006 at the Nepal Climate Observatory-Pyramid (NCO-P) located at 5079 m a.s.l. on the southern foothills of Mt. Everest, in the framework of ABC-UNEP and SHARE-Ev-K2-CNR projects. The work presents a characterization of meteorological conditions and air-mass circulation at NCO-P during the first two years of activity. The mean values of atmospheric pressure, temperature and wind speed recorded at the site were: 551 hPa, -3.0 {$^\circ$}C, 4.7 m s-1, respectively. The highest seasonal values of temperature (1.7 {$^\circ$}C) and relative humidity (94\%) were registered during the monsoon season, which was also characterized by thick clouds, present in about 80\% of the afternoon hours, and by a frequency of cloud-free sky of less than 10\%. The lowest temperature and relative humidity seasonal values were registered during winter, -6.3 {$^\circ$}C and 22\%, respectively, the season being characterised by mainly cloud-free sky conditions and rare thick clouds. The summer monsoon influenced rain precipitation (seasonal mean: 237 mm), while wind was dominated by flows from the bottom of the valley (S--SW) and upper mountain (N--NE). (...)},

  abstract = {Abstract. A multitude of physical and biological processes on which ecosystems and human societies depend are governed by the climate, and understanding how these processes are altered by climate change is central to mitigation efforts. We developed a set of climate-related variables at as yet unprecedented spatiotemporal detail as a basis for environmental and ecological analyses. We downscaled time series of near-surface relative humidity (hurs) and cloud area fraction (clt) under the consideration of orography and wind as well as near-surface wind speed (sfcWind) using the delta-change method. Combining these grids with mechanistically downscaled information on temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation, we then calculated vapor pressure deficit (vpd), surface downwelling shortwave radiation (rsds), potential evapotranspiration (pet), the climate moisture index (cmi), and site water balance (swb) at a monthly temporal and 30\,arcsec spatial resolution globally from 1980 until 2018 (time-series variables). At the same spatial resolution, we further estimated climatological normals of frost change frequency (fcf), snow cover days (scd), potential net primary productivity (npp), growing degree days (gdd), and growing season characteristics for the periods 1981--2010, 2011--2040, 2041--2070, and 2071--2100, considering three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP126, SSP370, SSP585) and five Earth system models (projected variables). Time-series variables showed high accuracy when validated against observations from meteorological stations and when compared to alternative products. Projected variables were also highly correlated with observations, although some variables showed notable biases, e.g., snow cover days. Together, the CHELSA-BIOCLIM+ dataset presented here (https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.332, Brun et al., 2022) allows improvement to our understanding of patterns and processes that are governed by climate, including the impact of recent and future climate changes on the world's ecosystems and the associated services on societies.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic distance is a key measure used to develop species lists for host specificity tests that delimit the fundamental and realised host range of candidate weed biocontrol agents to meet the assumptions of the centrifugal phylogenetic method. Plant pathogens and insects, even those with broad host ranges, exhibit some degree of phylogenetic conservatism in their host plant associations. Thorough host specificity testing is crucial to minimise the risk of off-target damage to native and economically important plant species. Host test lists need to be developed from an understanding of evolutionary relationships, usually visualised as a phylogenetic tree, together with plant functional traits, and geospatial information. Currently, the process of obtaining a host test list is not standardised, and the manual steps are time-consuming and challenging. We introduce a user-friendly, open-source visualisation tool called PhyloControl to aid researchers in biocontrol risk analysis. PhyloControl integrates taxonomic data, molecular data, spatial data, and plant traits in an intuitive interactive interface, empowering biocontrol practitioners to summarise, visualise and analyse data efficiently. Comprehensively sampled phylogenetic trees are often unavailable, and older published phylogenies often lack branch resolution and support, which increases uncertainty. PhyloControl includes a workflow implemented through Quarto notebooks in R that allows users to perform phylogenetic analyses on GenBank DNA sequences. The modular workflow also incorporates species distribution modelling to predict the current and potential extent of target weed species. PhyloControl will streamline the development of biocontrol host tests lists to support risk analysis and decision making in classical weed biological control.},

  abstract = {The performance of gridded precipitation products is especially important over mountainous regions because of the lack of observations. This study provides a detailed evaluation of the spatial precipitation patterns presented by the ERA-Interim, ERA5, ERA5-Land, and refined HAR datasets with spatial resolutions from coarse to fine (0.7{$^\circ$}, 0.25{$^\circ$}, 0.1{$^\circ$}, and 0.1{$^\circ$}, respectively) over the southern slope of central Himalaya, Nepal. The major findings are as follows: (1) The high-resolution ERA5-Land and ERA5 datasets well present the observed spatial pattern of precipitation but with a generally overestimated amount; the refined HAR dataset also presents many fine-scale details, while the coarse resolution ERA-Interim dataset tends to exhibit a too gentle spatial characteristic in mountainous Nepal. (2) The four datasets well reproduce the seasonal precipitation variation (R {$>$} 0.90) over the country; however, their performance varies spatially across the western, central, and eastern regions. The spatial resolution is also important in representing the terrain blocking of water vapor from the Bay of Bengal, which is transported from east to west in Nepal. (3) The high-resolution datasets can reproduce the elevation dependency as revealed by the observed dataset, while the coarse-resolution cannot capture the elevation dependency in the high-elevation regions. Moreover, all four datasets show very similar performance in low--elevation plane areas, however, higher resolution simulations (ERA5, ERA5--Land, and HAR) better reflect blocking effect of orographic precipitation and outperform ERA-Interim in high--elevation areas where the terrain is very complex and the slope is very steep.},

  abstract = {The meteorology of monsoons -- Controls on the Asian monsoon over tectonic timescales -- Monsoon evolution on tectonic timescales -- Monsoon evolution on orbital timescales -- Erosional impact of the Asian monsoon -- The late holocene monsoon and human society The Asian monsoon is one of the most dramatic climatic phenomena on Earth, with far-reaching environmental and societal effects. Almost two thirds of humanity lives within regions influenced by the monsoon. With the emerging Asian economies, the importance of the region to the global economy has never been more marked. The Asian Monsoon describes the evolution of the monsoon, and proposes a connection between the tectonic evolution of the solid Earth and monsoon intensity. The authors explain how the monsoon has been linked to orbital processes and thus to other parts of the global climate system, especially glaciation. Finally, they summarize how monsoon evolution since the last Ice Age has impacted human societies, as well as commenting on the potential impact of future climate change. This book presents a multi-disciplinary overview of the monsoon for advanced students and researchers in atmospheric science, climatology, oceanography, geophysics, and geomorphology}

  abstract = {In recent decades there has been an increasing demand by ecologists for harmonized climatic data at large spatial scales and spanning long periods. Here we present easyclimate, a software package to obtain daily climatic data at high resolution (0.0083º, {\textasciitilde}1 km) with R. The package facilitates the downloading and processing of precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures for Europe from 1950 to 2020. Using easyclimate and given a set of coordinates (points or polygons) and dates (days or years), the user can download the climatic information as a tidy table or a raster object. In this package we implemented Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs which provide access to daily climate data for thousands of sites/days within minutes, without having to download huge rasters. Daily climate data are not available in many of the current climate databases and are essential for many ecological research questions and applications, including the study of the effects of extreme climatic events related to late-spring frosts, heat waves, or dry periods on plant performance. easyclimate taps the potential for climatic data and enables multiple applications in forestry, ecological and vegetation studies across Europe.},

  abstract = {Methodological research on species distribution modelling (SDM) has so far largely focused on the choice of appropriate modelling algorithms and variable selection approaches, but the consequences of choosing amongst different sources of environmental data has scarcely been investigated. Bioclimatic variables are commonly used as predictors in SDMs. Currently, several online databases offer the same sets of bioclimatic variables, but they differ in underlying source of raw data and method of data processing (extrapolation and downscaling). In this paper, we asked whether predictive performance and spatial transferability of SDMs are affected by the choice of two different bioclimatic databases viz. WorldClim 2 and Chelsa 1.2. We used presence-absence data of the invasive plant Ageratina adenophora from the Western Himalaya for training SDMs and a set of independently-collected presence-only datasets from the Central and Eastern Himalaya to evaluate the transferability of the SDMs beyond the training range. We found that the performance of SDMs was, to a large degree, affected by the choice of the climatic dataset. Models calibrated on Chelsa 1.2 outperformed WorldClim 2 in terms of internal evaluation on the calibration dataset. However, when the model was transferred beyond the calibration range to the Central and Eastern Himalaya, models based on WorldClim 2 performed substantially better. We recommend that, in addition to the choice of predictor variables, the choice of predictor datasets with these variables should not be based merely on subjective decision whenever several options are available. Instead, such decisions should be based on robust evaluation of the most appropriate dataset for a given geographic region and species being modelled. Moreover, decisions could also depend on the objective of the study, i.e. projecting within the calibration range or beyond. Therefore, a quantitative evaluation of predictor datasets from alternative sources should be routinely performed as an integral part of the modelling procedure.}

  abstract = {Corine Land Cover 2018 (CLC2018) is one of the Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets produced within the frame the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service referring to land cover / land use status of year 2018. CLC service has a long-time heritage (formerly known as "CORINE Land Cover Programme"), coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA). It provides consistent and thematically detailed information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC datasets are based on the classification of satellite images produced by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA members and cooperating countries (EEA39). National CLC inventories are then further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database relies on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level CLC nomenclature; minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares; minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres. Change layers have higher resolution, i.e. minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 5 hectares for Land Cover Changes (LCC), and the minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres. The CLC service delivers important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Union as e.g. protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, monitoring urban land take, assessing developments in agriculture or dealing with water resources directives. CLC belongs to the Pan-European component of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (https://land.copernicus.eu/), part of the European Copernicus Programme coordinated by the European Environment Agency, providing environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. Additional information about CLC product description including mapping guides can be found at https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/. CLC class descriptions can be found at https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/corine-land-cover-nomenclature-guidelines/html/.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are usually based on a single data type, such as presence-only (PO), presence-absence (PA) or abundance (AA). Results from SDMs using single sources of data will suffer from inherent biases and limitations to that data type. For example, PO data contain sampling-bias and PA/AA data are often less expansive and more sparse. Integrated SDMs (ISDMs) combine multiple data types and have recently emerged as a way to leverage strengths and minimise weaknesses of the different data types. They pose a common (distribution) model and separate observation models for each of the data types. The `RISDM' package for the R environment (               www.r-project.org               ) provides access to this modelling framework using functions for preparation, fitting, interpreting and diagnosing models. The functionality of the package is demonstrated here using synthetic data sets.},

  abstract = {Landscape ecology, the study of the complex interactions between landscapes and ecological processes, has hugely benefited from the increase in widely available open-source software in recent years. In particular, the R programming language provides a wealth of community developed tools for landscape ecology. In this paper, we examine existing packages for downloading, processing and visualisation of spatial data, as well as those specifically developed for spatial ecological analysis. Additionally, we outline the results of a survey of R users within the landscape ecology community. We found that landscape ecologists are generally satisfied with the functionality available within R , and that as a community they are continually further developing the functionality available. Suggested future developments include improvement of computation performance; additional methods for landscape characterisation such as surface metrics; and advanced, accessible visualisation tools.},

We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that CHELSA climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.},

  abstract = {Microclimatic variables are necessary for a wide range of pure and applied problems in environmental science. In ecology, microclimatic conditions are prerequisites for modelling the heat and water budgets of organisms, from which climatic constraints on behaviour, life histories, distribution and abundance can be inferred. Despite the critical importance of microclimates, there is no general-purpose, accessible microclimate model available for use in ecological studies.             Here we introduce and document the microclimate model of the biophysical modelling package NicheMapR, an R package that includes a suite of programs for mechanistic modelling of heat and mass exchange between organisms and their environments. The NicheMapR microclimate model is based on a Fortran program originally developed by Porter, Mitchell, Beckman and McCullough for predicting hourly above- and below-ground conditions from meteorological, terrain, vegetation and soil data. The model includes routines for computing solar radiation, including effects of shading, slope, aspect and horizon angles (hillshade), and can include variable substrate properties with depth.             Here we configure the program to be called from R as part of the NicheMapR package, and describe the model in detail including new functionality for modelling soil water balance and snow, optional input of hourly or daily weather input data, and an R implementation of the Global Aerosol Data Set for obtaining local estimates of aerosol profiles as input to the model. We include scripts for core operation of the model, for building a global, monthly long-term average dataset with all necessary environmental inputs, for computing physical properties of air, and for running the model with the global climate database. Example applications are provided in the paper and in the associated vignettes, including customisation the model to run with user-supplied weather inputs.},

  abstract = {{$^\circ$} steep and west-northwest facing slope of the Black Forest mountain range (Germany) are used to analyze the thermal structure and the momentum budget associated with thermally induced slope winds. Acceleration of the air close to the ground is found to be directed nearly vertically downward during the night and nearly vertically upward during the day, rather than parallel to the slope. This means that during the night the airflow is deflected by the slope surface in the down-slope direction, whereas during daytime stable stratification above the heated slope layer is required to establish up-slope flow parallel to the slope. The diurnal cycle of the momentum budget of the along-slope wind component near the surface is analyzed in detail with respect to the driving forces (buoyancy and pressure gradient force) and friction. It is found that a small imbalance between forcing and friction is responsible for the diurnal change in slope flow intensity. The along-slope components of the horizontal pressure gradient force and the buoyancy force are shown to have the same order of magnitude. This means that for small to moderate slope angles the pressure gradient force cannot be neglected as is done in some analytical slope wind models. The reaction time of the slope flow to changes in forcing is estimated to be in the range of 30 to 120 seconds, which confirms the empirically known fact that slope winds react very quickly.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Advances in climate science have rendered obsolete the gridded observation data widely used in downstream applications. Novel climate reanalysis products outperform legacy data products in accuracy, temporal resolution, and provision of uncertainty metrics. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop a workflow through which to integrate these improved data into biological analyses. The ERA5 product family (ERA5 and ERA5-Land) are the latest and most advanced global reanalysis products created by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting. These data products offer up to 83 essential climate variables at hourly intervals for the time-period of 1981 to today with preliminary back-extensions being available for 1950--1981. Spatial resolutions range from 30 {\texttimes} 30 km (ERA5) to 11 {\texttimes} 11 km (ERA5-Land) and can be statistically downscaled to study-requirements at finer spatial resolutions. Kriging is one such method to interpolate data to finer resolutions and has the advantages that one can leverage additional covariate information and obtain the uncertainty associated with the downscaling. The KrigR R-package enables users to (a) download ERA5(-Land) climate reanalysis data for a user-specified region, and time-period, (b) aggregate these climate products to desired temporal resolutions and metrics, (c) acquire topographical co-variates, and (d) statistically downscale spatial data to a user-specified resolution using co-variate data via kriging. KrigR can execute all these tasks in a single function call, thus enabling the user to obtain any of 83 (ERA5)/50 (ERA5-Land) climate variables at high spatial and temporal resolution with a single R-command. Additionally, KrigR contains functionality for computation of bioclimatic variables and aggregate metrics from the variables offered by ERA5(-Land). This R-package provides an easy-to-implement workflow for implementation of state-of-the-art climate data while avoiding issues of storage limitations at high temporal and spatial resolutions by providing data according to user-needs rather than in global data sets. Consequently, KrigR provides a toolbox to obtain a wide range of tailored climate data at unprecedented combinations of high temporal and spatial resolutions thus enabling the use of world-leading climate data through the R-interface and beyond.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Instrumental climate records of the last centuries suffer from multiple breaks due to relocations and changes in measurement techniques. These breaks are detected by relative homogenization algorithms using the difference time series between a candidate and a reference. Modern multiple changepoint methods use a decomposition approach where the segmentation explaining most variance defines the breakpoints, while a stop criterion restricts the number of breaks. In this study a pairwise multiple breakpoint algorithm consisting of these two components is tested with simulated data for a range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) found in monthly temperature station datasets. The results for low SNRs obtained by this algorithm do not differ much from random segmentations; simply increasing the stop criterion to reduce the number of breaks is shown to not be helpful. This can be understood by considering that, in case of multiple breakpoints, even a random segmentation can explain about half of the break variance. We derive analytical equations for the explained noise and break variance for random and optimal segmentations. From these we conclude that reliable break detection at low but realistic SNRs needs a new approach. The problem is relevant because the uncertainty of the trends of individual stations is shown to be climatologically significant also for these small SNRs. An important side result is a new method to determine the break variance and the number of breaks in a difference time series by studying the explained variance for random break positions. We further discuss the changes from monthly to annual scale which increase the SNR by more than a factor of 3.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, studies of climate--organism interactions usually rely on climate variables interpolated from widely spaced measurements or modelled at coarse resolution, whereas the conditions experienced by many organisms vary over scales from millimetres to metres.                                                     To help bridge this mismatch in scale, we present models of the mechanistic processes that govern fine-scale variation in near-ground air temperature. The models are flexible (enabling application to a wide variety of locations and contexts), can be run using freely available data and are provided as an R package.                                                                          We apply a mesoclimate model to the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to provide hourly estimates of air temperature at resolution of 100~m for the period Jan-Dec 2010. A microclimate model is then applied to a 1~km                     2                     region of the Lizard Peninsula, Caerthillean Valley (49.969{$^\circ$}N, 5.215{$^\circ$}W), to provide hourly estimates of near-ground air temperature at resolution of 1 m                     2                     during May 2010.                                                                        Our models reveal substantial spatial variation in near-ground temperatures, driven principally by variation in topography and, at the microscale, by vegetation structure. At the meso-scale, hours of exposure to air temperatures at 1 m height in excess of 25{$^\circ$}C ranged from 23 to 158~hr, despite this temperature never being recorded by the weather station within the study area during the study period. At the micro-scale, steep south-facing slopes with minimal vegetation cover experienced temperatures in excess of 40{$^\circ$}C.                                                     The microclima package is flexible and efficient and provides an accurate means of modelling fine-scale variation in temperature. We also provide functions that facilitate users to obtain and process a variety of freely available datasets needed to drive the model.},

A hydraulic approach is employed in which the detailed vertical structure of the flow is replaced by a quiescent stably stratified environment and an equivalent flowing layer which is subject to sustained layer cooling, surface stress and interfacial entrainment. A scaling which contains most of the parametric behavior is found. It shows that interfacial entrainment is the dominating retardation mechanism of the flow and that surface stress may be relatively unimportant. Steady solutions are presented to show that katabatic winds are essentially supercritical on all practical slopes (slope angles {$>$}0.1{$^\circ$}), and are affected by ambient stratification only at large distances. The model is in satisfactory quantitative agreement with the limited field data available.}

  abstract = {Betula utilis is a major constituent of alpine treeline ecotones in the western and central Himalayan region. The objective of this study is to analyse for the first time the performance of different climatic predictors in modelling the potential distribution of B. utilis in the subalpine and alpine belts of the Himalayan region. Using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) we aim at examining climatic factors controlling the species distribution under current climate conditions. We evaluate the predictive ability of climate data derived from different statistical methods GLMs were created using least correlated bioclimatic variables derived from two different climate data sets: 1) interpolated climate data (i.e. WORLDCLIM; Hijmans et al., 2005), and 2) quasi-mechanistical statistical downscaling (i.e. CHELSA; Karger et al., 2016). Model accuracy was evaluated using threshold-independent (Area Under the Curve) and threshold-dependent (True Skill Statistics) measures. Although there were no significant differences between the models in AUC, we found highly significant differences (p{$\leq$}0.01) in TSS. We conclude that models based on variables of CHELSA climate data had higher predictive power, whereas models using WORLDCLIM climate data consistently overpredicted the potential suitable habitat for B. utilis. Although climatic variables of WORLDCLIM are widely used in modelling species distribution, our results suggest to treat them with caution when topographically complex regions like the Himalaya are in focus. Unmindful usage of climatic variables for environmental niche models potentially causes misleading projections.},

  abstract = {The extent of the Postglacial is characterized by a main end moraine, which is called Great Lateral Moraine. In general its outer slope is very steep and the recent ice terminal retreated inwards and lost much volume. Between this stage of historical/latest Neoglacial an ice marginal position was found, which can only be classified into the earliest Neoglacial because of its glaciogeomorphic position. It lies ca. 5--6 km outside of the historical moraines and leads to snow line depressions of 300--600 m. This stage can not mixed up with the latest Late Glacial stage. Relating to the Late Glacial only moraine terraces or remnants were found in the steep valleys. In the Kangchenjunga Valley there is a large end moraine complex of Late Glacial at 2700 m, 27 km down-valley of the recent glacier termini and in the Yalung Valley (Simbua Khola, Kangchenjunga SW) we found a lateral moraine wall 600 m above the valley bottom of Torontan. In the Rolwaling Valley several indicators imply a former glaciation of the whole valley, which stretches out into the Bhote Kosi. In consideration of the maximum glaciation of Last Glacial (LGM) which has extended lower than 1000 m in the investigated areas it can be assumed that the levels of moraines valley- inwards are younger. Snow line depressions of 300--600 m for the Neoglacial (earliest stage) and 900--1200 m for the Late Glacial can be calculated.},

  abstract = {Sub-desertic thorny dwarf-shrublands characterise the arid high mountains between the Atlas and southern Tibet. In the Muktinath valley and within the entire Mustang district of N Nepal, they are represented by Caragana gerardiana-"Igelheiden" ('porcupine heath'). The question to which extent these sub-desertic shrublands are natural, is discussed in 3 approaches: (1) by comparative records and observations of the present vegetation along altitudinal and humidity gradients, (2) by interpretation of a pollen diagram from Jharkot, (3) by consideration of archaeological findings. Probably the lower part of the pollen profile documents the development of the Holocene primary forests until the formation of Pinus wallichiana forests in the surroundings of Jharkot during the middle-holocene climatic optimum. With good reliability, the clearing of the pine forests and the onset of pastoral land use around 5400 BP is proven (some 1,900 years prior to the earliest archaeological datings). With a certain probability, barley cultivation started at latest around 4500 BP. Since this initial occupation, at least the slopes below Jharkot remained devoid of forests. Pollen of the Caragana type first appears around 3200 BP. It is well imaginable that the Caragana thorn shrubs were introduced by the livestock accompanying new settlers, whose presence is also archaeologically documented in this period. From relict trees and indicative herbaceous species in the present vegetation it can be concluded that not only the relatively humid Muktinath valley, but the entire southern Mustang area could still support trees, at least open Cupressaceae stands. Consequently, the Caragana thorn formations represent a secondary vegetation up to the drought limit of tree growth (250 mm annual precipitation at most). In N Mustang, however, Caragana gerardiana grows beyond the drought limit of Juniperus indica in the dry valley ground, proving its nature of a semi-desert species. Its spreading into the forest belt has been favoured by human activities (woodcutting and livestock grazing) for at least 3,200 years. /// Die zwischen Atlas und S{\"u}dtibet f{\"u}r Hochgebirgshalbw{\"u}sten des altweltlichen Trockeng{\"u}rtels typischen Dornpolster-Formationen sind im Muktinath-Tal und im gesamten Mustang-Distrikt in Zentral-Nord-Nepal durch Caragana gerardiana-Igelheiden vertreten. Die Frage, inwieweit diese Halbw{\"u}sten-Formation nat{\"u}rlich ist, wird in drei verschiedenen Ans{\"a}tzen diskutiert: (1) durch vergleichende Aufnahmen und Beobachtungen der aktuellen Vegetation entlang von H{\"o}hen- und Feuchtegradienten, (2) durch Interpretation eines Pollendiagramms aus Jharkot, (3) durch Einbezug von arch{\"a}ologischen Forschungsergebnissen. Die Basis des Pollenprofils dokumentiert vermutlich die holoz{\"a}ne Waldentwicklung bis zur Bildung von Kiefernw{\"a}ldern in der N{\"a}he von Jharkot im mittelholoz{\"a}nen Klimaoptimum. Mit gro{\ss}er Wahrscheinlichkeit ist eine Rodung der Kiefernw{\"a}lder und der Beginn der Weidewirtschaft um etwa 5400 BP nachgewiesen (fast 1.900 Jahre fr{\"u}her als die {\"a}ltesten Datierungen arch{\"a}ologischer Zeugnisse), mit einer gewissen Wahrscheinlichkeit ab sp{\"a}testens 4500 BP der Getreideanbau. Seitdem sind zumindest die H{\"a}nge unterhalb von Jharkot waldfrei. Der Caragana-Pollentyp erscheint im Pollendiagramm erstmals um ca. 3200 BP. In der aktuellen Vegetation lassen Baumrelikte und Zeigerarten der Krautschicht darauf schlie{\ss}en, dass im gegenw{\"a}rtigen Klima nicht nur das relativ feuchte Muktinath-Tal, sondern das gesamte s{\"u}dliche Mustang zumindest Cupressaceen-Offenw{\"a}lder tragen k{\"o}nnte, dass also die Caragana-Igelheiden bis zur Trockengrenze der B{\"a}ume bei h{\"o}chstens 250 mm Jahresniederschlag eine anthropo-zoogene Ersatzgesellschaft darstellen. In Nord-Mustang kommt Caragana gerardiana {\"u}ber die Trockengrenze von Juniperus indica hinaus in der trockenen Talstufe vor und erweist sich damit als eine Halbw{\"u}sten-Art, deren Ausbreitung seit mindestens 3.200 Jahren durch den Menschen gef{\"o}rdert wurde.},

  abstract = {Understanding ecological patterns and response to climate change requires unbiased data on species distribution. This can be challenging, especially in biodiverse but extreme environments like the Himalaya. This study presents the results of the first ever application of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery for species-level mapping of vegetation in the Himalaya following a hierarchical Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) method. The first level of classification separated green vegetated objects from the rest with overall accuracy of 95\%. At the second level, seven cover types were identified (including four woody vegetation species). For this, the suitability of various spectral, shape and textural features were tested for classifying them using an ensemble decision tree algorithm. Spectral features alone yielded 70\% accuracy (kappa 0.66) whereas adding textural and shape features marginally improved the accuracy (73\%) but at the cost of a substantial increase in processing time. Contrast in plant morphological traits was the key to distinguishing nearby stands as different species. Hence, broad-leaved versus fine needle leaved vegetation were mapped more accurately than structurally similar classes such as Rhododendron anthopogon versus non-photosynthetic vegetation. Results highlight the potential and limitations of the suggested UAS-GEOBIA approach for detailed mapping of plant communities and suggests future research directions.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used in conservation and land-use planning as inputs to describe biodiversity patterns. These models can be built in different ways, and decisions about data preparation, selection of predictor variables, model fitting, and evaluation all alter the resulting predictions. Commonly, the true distribution of species is unknown and independent data to verify which SDM variant to choose are lacking. Such model uncertainty is of concern to planners. We analyzed how 11 routine decisions about model complexity, predictors, bias treatment, and setting thresholds for predicted values altered conservation priority patterns across 25 species. Models were created with MaxEnt and run through Zonation to determine the priority rank of sites. Although all SDM variants performed well (area under the curve {$>$}0.7), they produced spatially different predictions for species and different conservation priority solutions. Priorities were most strongly altered by decisions to not address bias or to apply binary thresholds to predicted values; on average 40\% and 35\%, respectively, of all grid cells received an opposite priority ranking. Forcing high model complexity altered conservation solutions less than forcing simplicity (14\% and 24\% of cells with opposite rank values, respectively). Use of fewer species records to build models or choosing alternative bias treatments had intermediate effects (25\% and 23\%, respectively). Depending on modeling choices, priority areas overlapped as little as 10-20\% with the baseline solution, affecting top and bottom priorities differently. Our results demonstrate the extent of model-based uncertainty and quantify the relative impacts of SDM building decisions. When it is uncertain what the best SDM approach and conservation plan is, solving uncertainty or considering alterative options is most important for those decisions that change plans the most. Efecto de las Decisiones sobre Modelos Adecuados de Distribuci{\'o}n de Especies sobre los Resultados de Conservaci{\'o}n Resumen Los modelos de distribuci{\'o}n de especies (MDEs) se usan cada vez m{\'a}s en la planeaci{\'o}n de la conservaci{\'o}n y del uso de suelo como contribuciones para describir los patrones de la biodiversidad. Estos modelos pueden construirse de maneras diferentes y las decisiones sobre la preparaci{\'o}n de datos, selecci{\'o}n de las variables de pron{\'o}stico y la adecuaci{\'o}n y evaluaci{\'o}n del modelo alteran las predicciones resultantes. Generalmente, la verdadera distribuci{\'o}n de las especies se desconoce y se carece de los datos independientes para verificar cu{\'a}l variante de MDE elegir. Dicha incertidumbre con los modelos es preocupante para los planificadores. Analizamos c{\'o}mo once decisiones rutinarias sobre el modelo, su complejidad, los predictores, el tratamiento del sesgo y el establecimiento de umbrales para los valores pronosticados alteraron los patrones de prioridades de conservaci{\'o}n para 25 especies. Creamos los modelos con MaxEnt y los corrimos en Zonation para determinar el rango de prioridad de los sitios. Aunque todas las variantes de los MDE tuvieron un buen desempe{\~n}o ({\'a}rea bajo la curva {$>$}0.7), todos produjeron predicciones espaciales diferentes para las especies y diferentes soluciones prioritarias de conservaci{\'o}n. Las prioridades tuvieron la alteraci{\'o}n m{\'a}s fuerte cuando se decidi{\'o} no considerar el sesgo o aplicar umbrales binarios a los valores pronosticados; en promedio, el 40\% y 35\%, respectivamente, de todas las celdas de la cuadr{\'i}cula recibieron una clasificaci{\'o}n opuesta de prioridad. Cuando se forz{\'o} una complejidad alta para el modelo, se alteraron menos las soluciones de conservaci{\'o}n que cuando se forz{\'o} la simplicidad (14\% y 24\% de las celdas con valores opuestos de clasificaci{\'o}n, respectivamente). El uso de menos registros de especies para construir modelos o elegir tratamientos alternativos para el sesgo tuvo efectos intermedios (25\% y 23\%, respectivamente). Seg{\'u}n la elecci{\'o}n del modelo, las {\'a}reas prioritarias se traslaparon m{\'i}nimamente en 10-20\% con la soluci{\'o}n de la l{\'i}nea base, afectando a las prioridades de arriba y abajo de maneras diferentes. Nuestros resultados demuestran el alcance de la incertidumbre basada en los modelos y cuantifican el impacto relativo de las decisiones al construir los MDE. Cuando no es seguro cu{\'a}l es el mejor plan de conservaci{\'o}n ni la mejor estrategia de MDE, es de suma importancia solucionar la incertidumbre o considerar soluciones alternativas para aquellas decisiones que m{\'a}s cambian los planes.}

  abstract = {Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) techniques were originally developed in the mid-1980s. In this century they are gaining increasing attention in the literature and in practical use as a powerful tool to support forest management strategies especially under climate change. In this review paper we consider species occurrence datasets, climatic and soil predictor variables, modelling algorithms, evaluation methods and widely used software for SDM studies. We describe several important and freely available sources for species occurrence and interpolated climatic data. We outline the use of both presence-only and presence/absence modelling algorithms including distance-based algorithms, machine learning algorithms and regression-based models. We conclude that SDM techniques provide a valuable asset for forest managers. However, it is essential to consider uncertainties behind the use of future climate change scenarios.},

  abstract = {Herein, the history of katabatic flow study is presented, along with a summary of the current status of katabatic flow research and prospective research avenues. 1. SUMMARY Katabatic flows, and their related brethren, have been the subject of written fascination by scientists since the decade of the 1840's, and have been observed far longer by naturalists. In Aristotle's Meteorologica published in 397 BC, we find perhaps the first oblique reference to katabatic flows or their valley flow brethren, which at that time were unnamed, '{\dots}perhaps a local wind called by the inhabitants Phoenicias. {\dots} westerly winds are counted as northerly because they blow from the sunset; {\dots} while those (winds) from the sunset are reached by the sun later and it soon leaves them.' Aristotle's observations and his statements therefrom regarding meteorology and winds are riddled with errors, and even seem laughable in comparison with the knowledge we have gained to date. The word 'katabatic' being of Hellenic origin ('kata' downward, 'batos' moving beyond) and meaning 'downward moving', is applied to complex terrain winds that arise from negative bouyancy forces on a parcel of air. These winds are often called 'local', 'mountain', 'valley', 'drainage' or 'downslope' winds by different authors in different disciplines, are ubiquitous over land and ice covered surfaces, particularly at night. These omnipresent flows effect the entire land surface of the Earth, requiring merely a cool source (or heat sink) at the lower boundary. Theory of their vertical structure, turbulence quantities and fundamental dynamics have been proposed, some of which have received more attention than others. Despite being prevalent, and in particular despite their significant role in determining the sensible weather experienced by human beings because of their near-surface region of influence, these flows are relatively poorly understood and are seldom well represented in numerical simulations of daily weather or climate. Observations of these flows are wherefrom the interest in them began (e.g. Fournet 1840), however, and to this day, a comprehensive understanding of katabatic flow, its interaction with other flows and its role in our climate system does not exist despite a variety of field studies. This review will emphasize an understanding of the historical work on katabatic flows and the more recent work on causes of variation in such flows. Other reviews of slope and valley flows can be found, for example, in Defant (1951), Geiger (1975) and Whiteman (1990). The most thorough analysis and interpretation of the first century (1800's through 1945) of katabatic flow investigation can be found in Hawkes (1947). Future research avenues are discussed as related to emerging interdisciplinary scientific questions and in fundamental observational and numerical modeling of the roughness sublayer within which katabatic flows form.},

  abstract = {Since global reanalysis datasets first appeared in the 1990s, they have become an essential tool to understand the climate of the past. The wind power industry uses those products extensively for wind resource assessment, while several climate services for energy rely on them as well. Nowadays various datasets coexist, which complicates the selection of the most suitable source for each purpose. In an effort to identify the products that best represent the wind speed features at turbine hub heights, five state-of-the-art global reanalyses have been analysed: ERA5, ERA-Interim, the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55), the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications-2 (MERRA2), and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis 1 (R1). A multi-reanalysis ensemble approach is used to explore the main differences amongst these datasets in terms of surface wind characteristics. Then, the quality of the surface and near-surface winds is evaluated with a set of 77 instrumented tall towers. Results reveal that important discrepancies exist in terms of boreal winter seasonal means, interannual variability (IAV), and decadal linear trends. The differences in the computation of these parameters, which are mainly concentrated inland, reach up to the order of magnitude of the parameters themselves. Comparison with in situ observations shows that the ERA5 surface winds offer the best agreement, correlating and reproducing the observed variability better than a multi-reanalysis mean in 35.1\% of the tall tower sites on a daily time-scale. However, none of the reanalyses stands out from the others when comparing seasonal mean winds. Regarding the IAV, near-surface winds from ERA5 offer the values closest to the observed IAV.},

The three-dimensional topography used in this study is composed of two, two-dimensional topographies: one a slope connecting a plain with a plateau and the other a valley with a horizontal floor. The present two-dimensional simulations of the valley flow agree with results of previous investigations in that the heated sidewalls produce upslope flows that require a compensating subsidence in the valley core bringing down potentially warmer air from the stable free atmosphere. In the context of the three-dimensional valley--plain simulations, the authors find that this subsidence heating in the valley core is the main contributor to the valley-- plain temperature contrast, which, under the hydrostatic approximation, is the main contributor to the valley-- plain pressure difference that drives the up-valley wind.},

  abstract = {In the face of the growing challenges brought about by human activities, effective planning and decision-making in biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, restoration, and sustainable development are urgently needed. Ecological models can play a key role in supporting this need and helping to safeguard the natural assets that underpin human wellbeing and support life on land and below water (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; SDG 15 \& 14). The urgency and complexity of safeguarding forest (SDG 15.2) and mountain ecosystems (SDG 15.4), for example, and halting decline in biodiversity (SDG 15.5) in the Anthropocene requires a re-envisioning of how ecological models can best support the comprehensive assessments of biodiversity and its change that are required for successful action. A key opportunity to advance ecological modeling for both predictive and explanatory purposes arises through a collaboration between ecologists and the Earth observation community, and a close integration of remote sensing and species distribution models. Remote sensing products have the capacity to provide continuous spatiotemporal information about key factors driving the distribution of organisms, therefore improving both the use and accuracy of these models for management and planning. Here we first survey the literature on remote sensing data products available to ecological modelers interested in improving predictions of species range dynamics under global change. We specifically explore the key biophysical processes underlying the distribution of species in the Anthropocene including climate variability, changes in land cover, and disturbances. We then discuss potential synergies between the ecological modeling and remote sensing communities, and highlight opportunities to close the data and conceptual gaps that currently impede a more effective application of remote sensing for the monitoring and modeling of ecological systems. Specific attention is given to how potential collaborations between the two communities could lead to new opportunities to report on progress towards global agendas - such as the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development of the United Nations or the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework of the Convention for Biological Diversity, and help guide conservation and management strategies towards sustainability.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of contemporary climate databases calls for comparative studies testing their performance in ecological modelling. We evaluated how contemporary climate data sources interact with the modelling algorithm and affect the predictive accuracy of Species Distribution Models (SDMs). We modelled the distribution of 37 woody plants in the Iberian Peninsula using three global climate databases: WorldClim (WC), CHELSA (CH) and MERRAclim (MER); a regional climate database (the Iberian Climate Atlas, ICA), and three modelling algorithms: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and Partial Least Squared Regressions (PLSRs). The predictive capacity of the models was estimated by performing an external evaluation while controlling for extrapolation issues. The climate database source variable and its interaction with the modelling algorithm variable showed significant effects on a model's predictive performance. Post hoc tests revealed that MER produced the lowest discrimination capacity scores, especially using GLMs as algorithm. PLSR models were significantly better than GLMs when MER was used. GAMs and PLSR models with MER were significantly worse than some ICA and CH models but not worse than any of the WC models. These results indicate that contemporary climate data sources need to be considered as a seedbed of uncertainty in SDMs and that poorly flexible algorithms are unable to deal with suboptimal data. CH is a reliable global climate database and PLSR is a technique worth considering in SDMs. The best practice is to select the most accurate climate data available and to choose the algorithm based on the purpose of the study and on context-dependent technical details.},

  abstract = {Abstract Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to `Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain'. In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.

  abstract = {Abstract Motivation The intrinsic characteristics of islands make them a unique study system for the investigation of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. The Mediterranean Basin, an island-rich biodiversity hotspot, still lacks a comprehensive spatial database for these geographic features. This study presents the first comprehensive spatial database of all Mediterranean islands larger than 0.01\,km2, aiding ecological investigations and interdisciplinary research. Main types of variable contained The MEDIS spatial database offers detailed information on 39 geographic, climatic, ecological and land-use variables, including island area, perimeter, isolation metrics, climatic space, terrain data, land cover, palaeogeography, road networks and geological information, providing a multifaceted view of each island's characteristics. Spatial location and grain The study encompasses 2217 islands in the Mediterranean Basin larger than 0.01\,km2. The spatial grain of the datasets on which the selected variables are based varies from 10\,m (ESA WorldCover) to 1\,km (CHELSA-BIOCLIM+). Time period and grain The spatial database incorporates data from various sources, each with its own timeframe, such as the Global Shoreline Vector from 2014 Landsat imagery and the WorldCover dataset from 2021. Historical data like the Paleocoastlines GIS dataset offer insights into island configurations during the Last Glacial Maximum. Major taxa and level of measurement While not focusing on specific taxa, the study lays the foundation for comprehensive research on Mediterranean islands, facilitating comparisons and investigations into the distribution of native, endemic or alien species. The level of measurement is extensive, encompassing a wide range of variables and providing polygonal features rather than centroids' coordinates.},

Don) Spach) at central Himalayan treelines. The majority of recent studies detected current tree growth sensitivity to dry conditions during pre-monsoon seasons. The aim of this study was to analyze growth--climate relationships for more than a century for a treeline ecotone in east-central Nepal and to test for Blue Intensity (BI; used as a surrogate of maximum late wood density) as climate proxy. We determined the relationships of Abies spectabilis radial tree growth and BI to climate by correlating both to temperature, precipitation and drought index data. The results showed a significantly unstable dendroclimatic signal over time. Climate warming-induced moisture deficits during pre-monsoon seasons became a major factor limiting radial tree growth during recent decades. Earlier in time, the dendroclimatic signal was weaker, predominantly reflecting a positive relationship of tree growth and summer temperature. Compared to radial tree growth, BI showed a different but strong climate signal. Temporally unstable correlations may be attributed to increasing effects of above-average rates of climate warming. An extended network of Himalayan tree-ring sites is needed to further analyze cause--effect relationships and to solve this attribution problem.},

However, empirical studies in diverse mountain ranges give evidence of both advancing alpine treelines as well as rather insignificant responses. In this context, we aim at investigating the sensitivity and responsiveness of the near-natural treeline ecotone in Rolwaling Himal, Nepal, to climate warming. We analysed population densities of tree species along the treeline ecotone from closed forest stands via the krummholz belt to alpine dwarf shrub heaths (3700-4200 m) at 50 plots in 2013 and 2014. We quantified species - environment relationships, i.e. the change of environmental conditions (e.g., nutrient and thermal deficits, plant interactions) across the ecotone by means of redundancy analyses, variation partitioning and distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps. In particular, we focus on explaining the high competitiveness of Rhododendron campanulatum forming a dense krummholz belt and on the implications for the responsiveness of Himalayan krummholz treelines to climate change. Results indicate that treeline trees in the ecotone show species-specific responses to the influence of environmental parameters, and that juvenile and adult tree responses are modulated by environmental constraints in differing intensity. Moreover, the species - environment relationships suggest that the investigated krummholz belt will largely prevent the upward migration of other tree species and thus constrain the future response of Himalayan krummholz treelines to climate warming.},

Regeneration of tree species in the treeline ecotone is considered a sensitivity indicator and thus of great scientific interest. The aim of this study is to detect predictor variables for regeneration densities of the major tree species in central Himalayan treeline ecotones (Abies spectabilis, Betula utilis, Rhododendron campanulatum), analysing five development stages from seedling to mature tree. We applied negative binomial generalized linear models with predictors selected from a wide range of soil, topography, climate and stand characteristic variables. We found considerably varying predictors across the tree species and their stages of development. Soil conditions, topography and climate, as well as competing and facilitating tree species, had high predictive power for population densities. These predictors were clearly species- and development stage-specific. Predictors\&rsquo; spatial- and development-specific heterogeneity induce a high degree of complexity and diversify any potentially linear response of tree population densities and treeline position to changing climatic conditions.},

Thus, climate warming is expected to induce treelines to advance to higher elevations. Empirical studies in diverse mountain ranges, however, give evidence of both advancing alpine treelines as well as rather insignificant responses. Himalayan treeline ecotones show considerable differences in altitudinal position as well as in physiognomy and species composition. To assess the sensitivity of a near-natural treeline to climate warming at local scale, we analysed the relations between changes of growth parameters and temperature gradients along the elevational gradient in the treeline ecotone in Rolwaling valley, Nepal, by a multispecies approach. We observed species-specific transition patterns (diameter at breast height, height, tree and recruit densities) and varying degrees of abruptness of these transitions across the treeline ecotone resulting in a complex stand structure. Soil temperatures are associated with physiognomic transitions, treeline position and spatial regeneration patterns. In conclusion, treeline tree species have the potential to migrate upslope in future. Upslope migration, however, is controlled by a dense krummholz belt of Rhododendron campanulatum. Currently, the treeline is rather stable; however we found a prolific regeneration as well as signs of stand densification. Given the spatial heterogeneity of Himalayan treeline ecotones, further studies are needed to fully understand the complex conditions for the establishment and development of tree seedlings and the responsiveness of Himalayan treeline ecotones to climate change.}

This article reviews the key challenges relevant to the understanding of exchange processes in the mountain boundary layer and outlines possible research priorities for the future. The review describes the limitations of the experimental study of turbulent exchange over complex terrain, the impact of slope and valley breezes on the structure of the convective boundary layer, and the role of intermittent mixing and wave--turbulence interaction in the stable boundary layer. The interplay between exchange processes at different spatial scales is discussed in depth, emphasizing the role of elevated and ground-based stable layers in controlling multi-scale interactions in the atmosphere over and near mountains. Implications of the current understanding of exchange processes over mountains towards the improvement of numerical weather prediction and climate models are discussed, considering in particular the representation of surface boundary conditions, the parameterization of sub-grid-scale exchange, and the development of stochastic perturbation schemes.},

There are now numerous packages for computing ecological niche models (ENMs) with different algorithms, comparing species niches and niche models, creating virtual species, getting and preparing species and related environmental data, filtering species records, and evaluating models, amongst other tasks. This profusion of package options may be daunting for both beginners and more experienced R users. Here we provide an organised and annotated list of available packages for each task. We present a concise history of the creation of these packages, we briefly describe what each package does, and we discuss whether the current set of R packages covers all the necessities for modelling species' ecological niches.

  abstract = {A large-eddy simulation model with rotated coordinates and an open boundary is used to simulate the characteristics of katabatic flows over simple terrain. Experiments examine the effects of cross winds on the development of the slope-flow boundary layer for a steep (20{$^\circ$}). For the steep flow cases, comparisons between model average boundary-layer velocity, temperature deficit, and turbulence kinetic energy budget terms and tower observations show reasonable agreement. Results for different cross slope winds show that as the cross slope winds increase, the slope flow deepens faster and behaves more like a weakly stratified, sheared boundary layer. Analysis of the momentum budget shows that near the surface the flow is maintained by a balance between downslope buoyancy forcing and vertical turbulence flux from surface drag. Above the downslope jet, the turbulence vertical momentum flux reverses sign and acceleration of the flow by buoyancy is controlled by horizontal advection of slower moving ambient air. The turbulence budget is dominated by a balance between shear production and eddy dissipation, however, buoyancy and pressure transport both are significant in reducing the strength of turbulence above the jet. Results from the gentle slope case show that even a slight terrain variation can lead to significant drainage winds. Comparison of the gentle slope case with a flat terrain simulation indicates that drainage winds can effectively prevent the formation of very stable boundary layers, at least near the top of sloping terrain.},

  abstract = {The use of species distribution models (SDM) is of increasing popularity when studying biological invasions, e.g. to assess the impact of climate change on invasive species, to prioritize conservation measures, or to study invasive evolutionary biology. SDM correlate known occurrences of species with environmental variables and predict a species' potential distribution on other geographies over space and time. Today, SDM are widely used to produce invasion risk maps by delineating probable risk areas based on climatic suitability for a species. These maps can guide early detection and rapid response measures. While recent developments in modelling approaches and wider availability of environment datasets have helped to create better and more accurate SDM, in many cases the used models ignore the associated underlying ecological processes for e.g. dispersal and biotic interactions and thus provide only an incomplete picture of invasion risks. In this paper, we present a review of the most common applications of SDM in invasive species management and provide an overview of possible solutions to various challenges like uncertainty and transferability associated with them. Based on our review we conclude that ways towards more accurate model outputs include fitting models with existing ecological knowledge (hybrid models), address uncertainty and biotic interactions and link species dispersal traits with projections of species distributions. In the future, work is required on developing more hybrid approaches and models that addresses both local diffusion and long distance movement of alien species.},

An enhanced network of surface wind monitoring stations was established in the Canterbury region of the South Island to allow detailed study of meso-scale wind fields during the passage of fronts. Fivesoutherly changes occurred during the experiment, one of which failed to produce a clear wind change over much of the area. The often erratic movement of these fronts along the eastern side of the mountains is illustrated by isochrone maps of the onset of the wind change. Other general characteristics of these events include their shallowness (1000-1500 m deep) and in most cases their abrupt onset. Detailed analysis of anemograph data collected during SOUCHEX indicates great variability in the surface wind field associated with passage of the fronts. Maps of the meso-scale wind field plotted for the first southerly change of the 14 January 1988 illustrate the complexity of the wind changes experienced over the eastern South Island in particular. The arrival of the cold fronts at individual sites provided features of air mass interaction which appear to relate to time of day, and regional and local site factors. Variations, in wind, temperature and relative humidity provide clear examples of both single and double air mass changes. However, nocturnal changes seem to be less distinct due to lower ambient temperatures and increased boundary layer stability.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Under the changing climate, the persistence of Afrotemperate taxa may be threatened as suitable habitat availability decreases. The unique disjunct ranges of podocarps in southern Africa raise questions about the persistence of these species under climate change. Here, we identified likely environmental drivers of these distributions, characterized the current and future (2070) environmental niches, and projected distributions of four podocarp species in South Africa. Species distribution models were conducted using species locality data for Afrocarpus falcatus, Podocarpus latifolius, Pseudotropheus elongatus and Podocarpus henkelii and both historical climate data (1970--2000) and future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 4.5 and 8.5, 2061--2080) to estimate the current and future distributions. We also used this opportunity to identify the most important climatic variables that likely govern each species' distribution. Using niche overlap estimates, a similarity test, and indices of niche expansion, stability and unfilling, we explored how niches change under different climate scenarios. The distribution of the study species was governed by the maximum temperature of the warmest month, temperature annual range, mean temperature of the wettest quarter, and precipitation of the wettest, driest and warmest quarters. The current distribution of A. falcatus was predicted to expand to higher elevations under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Podocarpus henkelii was predicted to lose most of its suitable habitat under RCP 4.5 and expand under RCP 8.5; however, this was the opposite for P. elongatus and P. latifolius. Interestingly, P. elongatus, which had the smallest geographic distribution, showed the most vulnerability to climate change in comparison to the other podocarps. Mapping the distribution of podocarps and understanding the differences in their current and future climate niches provide insight into potential climate drivers of podocarp persistence and the potential for adaptation of these species. Overall, these results suggest that P. elongatus and P. henkelii may expand to novel environmental niches.},

  abstract = {This work investigates gap winds in a steep, deep river canyon prone to wildland fire. The driving mechanisms and the potential for forecasting the gap winds are investigated. The onset and strength of the gap winds are found to be correlated to the formation of an along-gap pressure gradient linked to periodic development of a thermal trough in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Numerical simulations are performed using a reanalysis dataset to investigate the ability of numerical weather prediction (NWP) to simulate the observed gap wind events, including the timing and flow characteristics within the canyon. The effects of model horizontal grid spacing and terrain representation are considered. The reanalysis simulations suggest that horizontal grid spacings used in operational NWP could be sufficient for simulating the gap flow events given the regional-scale depression in which the Salmon River Canyon is situated. The strength of the events, however, is under-predicted due, at least in part, to terrain smoothing in the model. Routine NWP, however, is found to have mixed results in terms of forecasting the gap wind events, primarily due to problems in simulating the regional sea level pressure system correctly.},

  abstract = {The thermally driven wind over mountainous terrains challenges the estimation of CO2 exchange between forests and the atmosphere when using the eddy covariance technique. In this study, the wind regimes were investigated in a temperate deciduous forested valley at the Maoershan site, Northeast China. The wind direction above the canopy was preferentially up-valley in the daytime and down-valley in the nighttime, corresponding to the diurnal patterns of above-canopy temperature gradient and stability parameter. In both leaf-on and -off nighttime, a down-valley flow with a maximum velocity of 1 3 m{\^a}{\textasciicircum}™s{\^a}{\textasciicircum}'1 was often developed at 42 m above the ground (2.3-fold of the canopy height). However, the below-canopy prevailing wind was down-slope in the night, contrast to the below-canopy temperature lapse and unstable conditions. This substantial directional shear illustrated shallow slope winds were superimposed on larger-scale valley winds. As a consequence, the valley-wind component becomes stronger with increasing height, indicating a clear confluence of drainage flow to the valley center. In the daytime, the below-canopy wind was predominated down-slope due to the temperature inversion and stable conditions in the leaf-on season, and was mainly up-valley or down-slope in the leaf-off season. The isolation of momentum flux and radiation by the dense canopy played a key role in the formation of the below-canopy unaligned wind and inverse stability. Significant lateral kinematic momentum fluxes were detected due to the directional shear. These findings suggested a significant interaction between slope and valley winds at this site. The frequent vertical convergence / divergence above the canopy and horizontal divergence/convergence below the canopy in the nighttime / daytime is likely to induce significant advections of trace gases and energy flux.},

  abstract = {Although treeline ecotones are significant components of vulnerable mountain ecosystems and key indicators of climate change, treelines of the Southern Hemisphere remain largely outside of research focus. In this study, we investigate, for the first time, the current and future distribution of the treeline species Nothofagus pumilio in the Southern Andes using a Species Distribution Modelling approach. The lack of modelling studies in this region can be contributed to missing occurrence data for the species. In a preliminary study, both point and raster data were generated using a novel Instagram ground truthing approach and remote sensing. Here we tested the performance of the two datasets: a typical binary species dataset consisting of occurrence points and pseudo-absence points and a continuous dataset where species occurrence was determined by supervised classification. We used a Random Forest (RF) classification and a RF regression approach. RF is applicable for both datasets, has a very good performance, handles multicollinearity and remains largely interpretable. We used bioclimatic variables from CHELSA as predictors. The two models differ in terms of variable importance and spatial prediction. While a temperature variable is the most important variable in the RF classification, the RF regression model was mainly modelled by precipitation variables. Heat deficiency is the most important limiting factor for tree growth at treelines. It is evident, however, that water availability and drought stress will play an increasingly important role for the future competitiveness of treeline species and their distribution. Modelling with binary presence--absence point data in the RF classification model led to an overprediction of the potential distribution of the species in summit regions and in glacier areas, while the RF regression model, trained with continuous raster data, led to a spatial prediction with small-scale details. The time-consuming and costly acquisition of complex species information should be accepted in order to provide better predictions and insights into the potential current and future distribution of a species.},

Recent research has focused on the temperature structure along the slope and valley axes that leads to the wind systems. Two new tools being used in these analyses include the topographic amplification factor, which quantifies the role of the topography in producing bulk temperature gradients along a valley's axis, and atmospheric heat budgets, which identify key physical processes leading to changes in temperature structure. Both tools are in an early stage of development, are being applied primarily to steady-state nighttime periods, and are leading to new concepts and understanding.}

  abstract = {This study investigates the wind energy potential in Hong Kong, a region with a complex terrain, by coupling the prognostic MM5 mesoscale model with the CALMET diagnostic model to produce high-resolution wind fields. Hourly wind fields were simulated for the entire year of 2004. The MM5 simulations were performed on a nested grid from 40.5 km down to 1.5 km horizontal resolution. The CALMET meteorological model was used in a domain that includes the entire Hong Kong region with a high horizontal resolution of 100 m. The MM5 model wind field (1.5 km horizontal resolution) output was input into the CALMET diagnostic meteorological model every hour along with an objective analysis procedure using all available observations. Verification was achieved through two steps. In the first step, the data from three meteorological surface stations that were not assimilated into the CALMET model were compared horizontally with the simulated wind fields. In the second step, the simulated wind fields were compared vertically with the vertical wind profile collected from two upper air sounding stations. The results of this study identified the locations of the highest wind energy potential in HK down to 100 m resolution.,,},

They use a high-resolution realistic topography but idealized large-scale conditions without any synoptic forcing to focus on the thermally induced valley wind system. The comparison with the available observations shows that this simplified set-up is sufficient to reproduce the essential features of the valley wind.},
